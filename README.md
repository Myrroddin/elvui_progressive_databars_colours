# ElvUI Progressive DataBars
The default DataBars (XP, Honor, Artifact, Reputation) in [URL="https://www.tukui.org/download.php?ui=elvui"]ElvUI[/URL] are visually boring, so spice them up! This plugin should work with all other ElvUI plugins, but if it doesn't, file a bug report via the link below.
