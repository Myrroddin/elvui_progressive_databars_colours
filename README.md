# ElvUI Progressive DataBars
The default DataBars (XP, Honor, Artifact, Reputation) in [ElvUI](https://www.tukui.org/) are visually boring, so spice them up! This plugin should work with all other ElvUI plugins, but if it doesn't, file a bug report via the link below.

## Supported WoW Versions

- Classic, which includes Classic Era, hardcore, and seasons
- Mists of Pandaria Classic
- Retail, currently that is The War Within

## The XP DataBar

- Blend the alpha/opacity of the bar as you gain XP
- Supported by all WoW versions

## The Reputation DataBar and Tooltip

- Blend the alpha/opacity of the bar as you gain reputation
- Pre-defined colours which you can change in ElvUI's main settings > DataBars and main settings > Tooltip
- Fills the repuation bar at Exalted (not applicable in Retail for Paragon or "Major" factions)
- Fills the reputation bar at Hated until you start gaining reputation
- Friendship factions (Mists & retail) are adjusted based on the number of ranks the faction has, meaning some may display higher than Hated colour to start and cap at Exalted colour

## The Honor DataBar

- Retail only
- Blend the alpha/opacity of the bar as you gain Honor

## The Azerite Power DataBar

- Retail only
- Blend the alpha/opacity of the bar as you gain Azerite Power
- Hidden if you do not have the legendary necklace
